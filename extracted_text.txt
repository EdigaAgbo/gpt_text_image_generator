Learning Objectives 
show what you will learn in each chapter.ABOUT THIS BOOK
This book is written for students following the Edexcel International GCSE (9–1) Science Double Award 
specification. You will need to study all of the content in this book for your examinations, except anything in Extension boxes. 
In each unit of this book, there are concise explanations and worked examples, plus numerous exercises 
that will help you build up confidence. The book also describes the methods for carrying out all of the required practicals.
The language throughout this textbook is graded for speakers of English as an additional language (EAL), 
with advanced Science-specific terminology highlighted and defined in the glossaries on the eBook. A list of command words at the back of the book will help you to learn the language you will need in your examinations. 
You will also find that questions in this book have Progression icons and Skills tags. The Progression icons 
refer to Pearson's Progression scale. This scale – from 1 to 12 – tells you what level you have reached in your learning and will help you to see what you need to do to progress to the next level. Furthermore, Edexcel have developed a Skills grid showing the skills you will practise throughout your time on the course. The skills in the grid have been matched to questions in this book to help you see which skills you are developing. You can find Pearson's Progression scale at www.pearsonglobalschools.com/igscienceprogression along with guidelines on how to use it. Edexcel’s skills grid can be found on their website.
Unit boxes tell you 
which units – for example, metres, grams and seconds – you will need to know and use for the study of a topic.Looking Ahead tells you what you would learn if you continued your study of Science to a higher level, such as International A Level.

Practicals describe the methods for carrying out 
all of the practicals you will need to know for your examination.Extension work boxes include content that is not on the specification and which you do not have to learn for your examination. However, it will help to extend your understanding of the topic.
Chapter Questions test your knowledge of the topic in that chapter. Unit Questions test your knowledge of the whole unit and provide quick, effective feedback on your progress.Progression icons show the level of difficulty according to the Pearson International GCSE Science Progression Scale.Skills tags tell you which skills you are practising in each question.

ORGANISMS AND LIFE PROCESSES
All living organisms are composed of microscopic units known as cells. These building blocks of 
life have a number of features in common, which allow them to grow, reproduce, and generate more organisms. In Chapter 1 we start by looking at the structure and function of cells, and the essential life processes that go on within them. Despite the fact that cells are similar in structure, there are many millions of different species of organisms. Chapter 2 looks at the diversity of living things and how we can classify them into groups on the basis of the features that they show.LIFE PROCESSES 03 THE VARIETY OF LIVING ORGANISMS 22

1 LIFE PROCESSES
All living organisms are composed of units called cells. The simplest 
organisms are made from single cells (Figure 1.1) but more complex plants and animals are composed of millions of cells. In many-celled (multicellular) organisms, there may be hundreds of different types of cells with different structures. They are specialised so that they can carry out particular functions in the animal or plant. Despite all the differences, there are basic features that are the same in all cells.

CELL STRUCTURE
This part of the book describes the cell structure of ‘higher’ organisms such as animals, plants and fungi. The cells of bacteria are simpler in structure and will be described in Chapter 2.
Most cells contain certain parts such as the nucleus, cytoplasm and cell 
membrane. Some cells have structures missing, for instance red blood cells are unusual in that they have no nucleus. The first chapter in a biology textbook will usually present diagrams of ‘typical’ plant and animal cells. In fact, there is really no such thing as a ‘typical’ cell. Humans, for example, are composed of hundreds of different kinds of cells – from nerve cells to blood cells, skin cells to liver cells. What we really mean by a ‘typical’ cell is a general diagram that shows all the features that you will find in most cells (Figure 1.2). However, not all these are present in all cells – for example the cells in the parts of a plant that are not green do not contain chloroplasts.

▲ Figur e 1.2 The structure of a ‘typical’ animal and plant cell.
The living material that makes up a cell is called cytoplasm. It has a texture rather like sloppy jelly, in other words somewhere between a solid and a liquid. Unlike a jelly, it is not made of one substance but is a complex material made of many different structures. You can’t see many of these structures under an ordinary light microscope. An electron microscope has a much higher magnification and can show the details of these structures, which are called organelles (Figure 1.3).

The largest organelle in the cell is the nucleus. Nearly all cells have a nucleus. 
The few types that don’t are usually dead (e.g. the xylem vessels in a stem, Chapter 11) or don’t live for very long (e.g. red blood cells, Chapter 5). The nucleus controls the activities of the cell. It contains chromosomes (46 in human cells) which carry the genetic material, or genes. Genes control the activities in the cell by determining which proteins the cell can make. The DNA remains in the nucleus, but the instructions for making proteins are carried out of the nucleus to the cytoplasm, where the proteins are assembled on tiny structures called ribosomes. A cell contains thousands of ribosomes, but they 
are too small to be seen through a light microscope.
One very important group of proteins found in cells are enzymes. Enzymes 
control the chemical reactions that take place in the cytoplasm.
All cells are surrounded by a cell membrane, sometimes called the cell 
surface membrane to distinguish it from other membranes inside the cell. This is a thin layer like a ‘skin’ on the surface of the cell. It forms a boundary between the cytoplasm of the cell and the outside. However, it is not a complete barrier. Some chemicals can pass into the cell and others can pass out. We say that the membrane is partially permeable. The membrane can go further than this and actually control the movement of some substances – it is selectively permeable.
One organelle that is found in the cytoplasm of all living cells is the 
mitochondrion (plural mitochondria). In cells that need a lot of energy such as muscle or nerve cells, there are many mitochondria. This gives us a clue to their function. They carry out some of the reactions of respiration (see page 11) releasing energy that the cell can use. Most of the energy from respiration is released in the mitochondria.
PLANT CELLSAll of the structures you have seen so far are found in both animal and plant cells. However, some structures are only ever found in plant cells.  There are three in particular – the cell wall, a permanent vacuole and chloroplasts.
The cell wall is a layer of non-living material that is found outside the 
cell membrane of plant cells. It is made mainly of a carbohydrate called cellulose, although other chemicals may be added to the wall in some cells. Cellulose is a tough material that helps the cell keep its shape and is one reason why the ‘body’ of a plant has a fixed shape. Animal cells do not have a cell wall and tend to be more variable in shape. Plant cells absorb water, producing an internal pressure that pushes against adjacent cells, giving the plant support (see Chapter 11). Without a cell wall strong enough to resist these pressures, this method of support would be impossible. The cell wall is porous, so it is not a barrier to water or dissolved substances. We call it freely permeable. 
Mature (fully grown) plant cells often have a large central space surrounded 
by a membrane, called a vacuole. This vacuole is a permanent feature of the cell. It is filled with a watery liquid called cell sap, which is a store of dissolved sugars, mineral ions and other solutes. Animal cells do contain vacuoles, but they are only small, temporary structures.
Cells of the green parts of plants, especially the leaves, contain another very 
important organelle, the chloroplast. Chloroplasts absorb light energy to make food in the process of photosynthesis (see Chapter 10). They contain a green pigment called chlorophyll. Cells from the parts of a plant that are not green, such as the flowers, roots and woody stems, have no chloroplasts.▲

ENZYMES: CONTROLLING REACTIONS IN THE CELL
The chemical reactions that take place in a cell are controlled by a group of proteins called enzymes. Enzymes are biological catalysts. A catalyst is a chemical which speeds up a reaction without being used up itself. It takes part in the reaction, but afterwards is unchanged and free to catalyse more reactions. Cells contain hundreds of different enzymes, each catalysing a different reaction. This is how the activities of a cell are controlled – the nucleus contains the genes, which control the production of enzymes, which then catalyse reactions in the cytoplasm:
genes → proteins (enzymes) → catalyse reactions
Everything a cell does depends on which enzymes it can make, which in turn depends on which genes in its nucleus are working.
What hasn’t been mentioned is why enzymes are needed at all. They are 
necessary because the temperatures inside organisms are low (e.g. the human body temperature is about 37
 °C) and without catalysts, most of the r
eactions 
that happen in cells would be far too slow to allow life to go on. The reactions can only take place quickly enough when enzymes are present to speed them up.
It is possible for there to be thousands of different sorts of enzymes because 
they are proteins, and protein molecules have an enormous range of structures and shapes (see Chapter 4). KEY POINT
The chemical reactions taking place 
in a cell are known as metabolic reactions. The sum of all the metabolic reactions is known as the metabolism of the cell. The function of enzymes is to catalyse metabolic reactions.
KEY POINT
You have probably heard of enzymes 
being involved in digestion of food. In the intestine enzymes are secreted onto the food to break it down. These are called extracellular enzymes, which means they function ‘outside cells’. However, most enzymes stay inside cells and carry out their function there;  they are intracellular. You will find out about digestive enzymes in Chapter 4.
KEY POINT
Secretion is the release of a fluid or 
substances from a cell or tissue.

The molecule that an enzyme acts on is called its substrate. Each enzyme has 
a small area on its surface called the active site. The substrate attaches to 
the active site of the enzyme. The reaction then takes place and products are formed. When the substrate joins up with the active site it lowers the energy needed for the reaction to start, allowing the products to be formed more easily. 
Enzymes also catalyse reactions where large molecules are built up from 
smaller ones. In this case, several substrate molecules attach to the active site, the reaction takes place and the larger product molecule is formed. The product then leaves the active site.
The substrate fits into the active site of the enzyme like a key fitting into a lock. 
Just as a key will only fit one lock, a substrate will only fit into the active site of a particular enzyme. This is known as the lock and key model of enzyme action. It is the reason why enzymes are specific, i.e. an enzyme will only catalyse one reaction.

▲ Figur e 1.5 Enzymes catalyse reactions at their active site. This acts like a ‘lock’ to the substrate 
‘key’ . The substrate fits into the active site, and products are formed. This happens more easily 
than without the enzyme – so enzymes act as catalysts.
After an enzyme molecule has catalysed a reaction, the product is released 
from the active site, and the enzyme is free to act on more substrate molecules.
FACTORS AFFECTING ENZYMESA number of factors affect the activity of enzymes. The rate of reaction may be increased by raising the concentration of the enzyme or the substrate. Two other factors that affect enzymes are temperature and pH.
TEMPERATURE
The effect of temperature on the action of an enzyme is easiest to see as a graph, where we plot the rate of the reaction against temperature (Figure 1.6).
Enzymes in the human body have evolved to work best at body temperature 
(37
 °C). The gr
aph in Figure 1.6 shows a peak on the curve at this temperature, 
which is called the optimum temperature for the enzyme.
As the enzyme is heated up to the optimum temperature, the rise in 
temperature increases the rate of reaction. This is because higher temperatures give the molecules of the enzyme and the substrate more kinetic energy, so they collide more often. More collisions means that the reaction will take place more frequently. KEY POINT
‘Optimum’ temperature means the 
‘best’ temperature, in other words the temperature at which the reaction takes place most rapidly.
DID YOU KNOW?
Kinetic energy is the energy 
an object has because of its movement. The molecules of enzyme and substrate are moving faster, so they have more kinetic energy.

▲ Figur e 1.6 Effect of temperature on the action of an enzyme.
However, above the optimum, temperature starts to have another effect. Enzymes are made of protein, and proteins are broken down by heat. From 40
 °C upwar
ds, the heat destroys the enzyme. We say that it is denatured. 
You can see the effect of denaturing when you boil an egg. The egg white is made of protein, and turns from a clear runny liquid into a white solid as the heat denatures the protein. Denaturing changes the shape of the active site so that the substrate will no longer fit into it. Denaturing is permanent – the enzyme molecules will no longer catalyse the reaction.
Not all enzymes have an optimum temperature near 37
 °C, only those of 
animals such as mammals and bir
ds, which all have body temperatures 
close to this value. Enzymes have evolved to work best at the normal 
body temperature of the organism. Bacteria that always live at an average temperature of 10
 °C will pr
obably have enzymes with an optimum temperature 
near 10
 
°C.
pH
The pH around the enzyme is also important. The pH inside cells is neutral (pH 7) and most enzymes have evolved to work best at this pH. At extremes of pH either side of neutral, the enzyme activity decreases, as shown in Figure 1.7. The pH at which the enzyme works best is called its optimum pH. Either side of the optimum, the pH affects the structure of the enzyme molecule and changes the shape of its active site, so that the substrate will not fit into it so well.

Although most enzymes work best at 
a neutral pH, a few have an optimum below or above pH 7. The stomach produces hydrochloric acid, which makes its contents very acidic (see Chapter 4). Most enzymes stop working at a low pH, but the stomach makes an enzyme called pepsin which has an optimum pH of about 2, so that it is adapted to work well in these unusually acidic surroundings.

by the time:
Rate =    5.0

Plotting a graph of rate against temperature should produce a curve similar to the one shown in Figure 1.6. Try this, using the results in the table. Better still, you may be able to do this experiment and provide your own results.

HOW THE CELL GETS ITS ENERGY
A cell needs a source of energy in order to be able to carry out all the 
processes needed for life. It gets this energy by breaking down food molecules to release the stored chemical energy that they contain. This process is called respiration. Many people think that respiration means the same as ‘breathing’, but although there are links between the two processes, the biological meaning of respiration is very different. 
Respiration happens in all the cells of our body. Oxygen is used to oxidise 
food, and carbon dioxide (and water) are released as waste products. The main food oxidised is a sugar called glucose. Glucose contains stored chemical energy that can be converted into other forms of energy that the cell can use. It is rather like burning a fuel to get the energy out of it, except that burning releases most of the energy as heat. Respiration releases some heat energy, but most is used to make a substance called ATP (see below). The energy stored in the ATP molecules can then be used for a variety of purposes, such as:
 ◾contr
action of muscle cells, producing movement
 ◾active tr
ansport of molecules and ions (see page 17)
 ◾building lar
ge molecules, such as proteins
 ◾cell division.
The ener
gy released as heat is also used to maintain a constant body 
temperature in mammals and birds (see Chapter 8).
The overall reaction for respiration is:

C6H12O6 +  6O2  →  6CO2 +  6H2O (+ ener gy) 
DID YOU KNOW?
Carbon from the respired glucose passes out into the atmosphere as 
carbon dioxide. The carbon can be traced through this pathway using a radioactive form of carbon called carbon-14.
This is called aerobic respiration, because it uses oxygen. Aerobic 
respiration happens in the cells of humans and those of animals, plants and many other organisms. It is important to realise that the equation above is only a summary of the process. It actually takes place gradually, as a sequence of small steps, which release the energy of the glucose in small amounts. Each step in the process is catalysed by a different enzyme. The later steps in the process are the aerobic ones, and these release the most energy. They happen in the mitochondria of the cell.
ATP – THE ENERGEY ‘CURRENCY’ 
OF THE CELL Respiration releases energy while other cell processes use it up. Cells have a 
way of passing the energy from respiration to the other processes that need it. They do this using a chemical called adenosine triphosphate or ATP . ATP is 
present in all living cells.KEY POINT
Respiration is called an oxidation 
reaction, because oxygen is used to break down food molecules.

ATP is composed of an organic molecule called adenosine attached to three 
phosphate groups. In a cell, ATP can be broken down losing one phosphate group and forming adenosine diphosphate or ADP (Figure 1.9 (a)).

▲ Figur e 1.9 ATP is the energy ‘currency’ of the cell.
When this reaction takes place, chemical energy is released and can be used to drive metabolic processes that need it.
During respiration the opposite happens – energy from the oxidation of 
glucose is used to drive the reverse reaction and a phosphate is added onto ADP (Figure 1.9
 (b)).
A
TP is often described as the energy ‘currency’ of the cell. It transfers energy 
between the process that releases it (respiration) and the processes in a cell that use it up.
ANAEROBIC RESPIRATIONThere are some situations where cells can respire without using oxygen. This is called anaerobic respiration. In anaerobic respiration, glucose is not completely broken down, so less energy is released. The advantage of anaerobic respiration is that it can occur in situations where oxygen is in short supply. Two important examples of this are in yeast cells and muscle cells.
Yeasts are single-celled fungi. They are used in commercial processes such 
as making wine and beer, and baking bread. When yeast cells are prevented from getting enough oxygen, they stop respiring aerobically and start to respire anaerobically instead. The glucose is partly broken down into ethanol (alcohol) and carbon dioxide:
glucose → ethanol + carbon dioxide (+ some energy)
This process is described in more detail in Chapter 21. The ethanol from this type of respiration is the alcohol formed in wine- and beer-making. The carbon dioxide is the gas that makes bread dough rise. 
Think about the properties of ethanol – it makes a good fuel and will burn to 
produce a lot of heat, so it still has a lot of chemical energy ‘stored’ in it.
Muscle cells can also respire anaerobically when they are short of oxygen. If 
muscles are overworked, the blood cannot reach them fast enough to deliver enough oxygen for aerobic respiration. This happens when a person does a ‘burst’ of activity, such as a sprint, or quickly lifting a heavy weight. This time the glucose is broken down into a substance called lactate:
glucose → lactate (+ some energy)
Anaerobic respiration provides enough energy to keep the overworked muscles going for a short period. During the exercise, the level of lactate rises in the muscle cells and bloodstream.

DID YOU KNOW?
It was once thought that lactate was toxic and caused muscle fatigue. 
We now know that this is not true. In fact physiologists have shown that lactate actually delays muscle fatigue. Fatigue is caused by other changes that happen in the muscles during exercise.
After the exercise the lactate is respired aerobically in the mitochondria. The 
volume of oxygen needed to completely oxidise the lactate that builds up in the body during anaerobic respiration is called the oxygen debt.

The indicator is sensitive to small changes in carbon dioxide concentration, and can be used to show production of carbon dioxide by small organisms such as woodlice, maggots (fly larvae) or germinating seeds.
The organisms are placed in a stoppered boiling tube with the indicator, 
as shown in Figure 1.10. The gauze platform supports the organisms above the hydrogen carbonate indicator solution and stops them from coming into contact with the chemical.

When you have made your prediction (called a ‘hypothesis’), plan an 
investigation to test it. Take care to consider the variables that need to be controlled variable, and don’t forget to include a description of a fourth tube that you would need to set up as the experimental Control (see Appendix A for an explanation of these terms).

▼ PRAC TICAL: DEMONSTRATION THAT HEAT IS PRODUCED 
BY RESPIRATION
Some peas are soaked in water for 24 hours, so that they start to 
germinate. A second batch of peas is boiled, to kill them. Each set of peas is washed in a 1% bleach solution, which acts as a disinfectant, killing any bacteria present on the surface of the peas. The peas are then rinsed twice in distilled water to remove any traces of bleach.
Each batch of peas is placed in an inverted vacuum flask as shown in 
Figure 1.11, leaving some air in each flask. A vacuum flask insulates its contents, so that any small temperature change inside the flask can be measured.

MOVEMENT OF MATERIALS IN AND OUT OF CELLS
Cell respiration shows the need for cells to be able to take in certain 
substances from their surroundings, such as glucose and oxygen, and get rid of others, such as carbon dioxide and water. As you have seen, the cell surface membrane can control which chemicals can pass in and out – it is described as selectively permeable. 
There are three main ways that molecules and ions can move through the 
membrane. They are diffusion, active transport and osmosis.
DIFFUSIONMany substances can pass through the membrane by diffusion. Diffusion happens when a substance is more concentrated in one place than another. For example, if the cell is making carbon dioxide by respiration, the concentration of carbon dioxide inside the cell will be higher than outside. This difference in concentration is called a concentration gradient. The molecules of carbon dioxide are constantly moving about because of their kinetic energy. The cell membrane is permeable to carbon dioxide, so the molecules can move in either direction through it. Since there is a higher concentration of carbon dioxide molecules inside the cell than outside, over time, more molecules will move from inside to outside than move in the other direction. We say that there is a net movement of the molecules out of the cell (Figure 1.12).
carbon dio xide
molecules
▲ Figur e 1.12 Carbon dioxide is produced by respiration, so its concentration builds up inside the 
cell. Although the carbon dioxide molecules diffuse in both directions across the cell membrane, 
the overall (net) movement is out of the cell, down the concentration gradient. 
The opposite happens with oxygen. Respiration uses up oxygen, so there is 
a concentration gradient of oxygen from outside to inside the cell. There is therefore a net movement of oxygen into the cell by diffusion.
The rate of diffusion is affected by various factors.
 ◾The concentr
ation gradient. Diffusion happens more quickly when there is a 
steep concentration gradient (i.e. a big difference in concentrations between 
two areas).
 ◾The sur
face area to volume ratio. A larger surface area in proportion to the 
volume will increase the rate.
 ◾The distance. The r
ate is decreased if the distance over which diffusion has 
to take place is greater.
 ◾The t
emperature. The rate is greater at higher temperatures. This is because 
a high temperature provides the particles with more kinetic energy.KEY POINT
Diffusion is the net movement of 
particles (molecules or ions) from a region of high concentration to a region of low concentration, i.e. down a concentration gradient.

ACTIVITY 4
▼ PRAC TICAL: DEMONSTRATION OF DIFFUSION IN A JELLY
Agar is a jelly that is used for growing cultures of bacteria. It has a 
consistency similar to the cytoplasm of a cell. Like cytoplasm, it has a high water content. Agar can be used to show how substances diffuse through a cell. 
This demonstration uses the reaction between hydrochloric acid and 
potassium permanganate solution. When hydrochloric acid comes into contact with potassium permanganate, the purple colour of the permanganate disappears.
A Petri dish is prepared which contains a 2 cm deep layer of agar jelly, 
dyed purple with potassium permanganate. Three cubes of different sizes are cut out of the jelly, with side lengths 2 cm, 1 cm and 0.5 cm. The cubes have different volumes and total surface areas. They also have a different surface area to volume ratio, as shown in the table below.

0.5 (0.5 × 0.5 × 0.5) = 0.125 (0.5 × 0.5) × 6 = 1.5 1.5/0.125 = 12
Notice that the smallest cube has the largest surface area to volume ratio. The same is true of cells – a small cell has a larger surface area to volume ratio than a large cell.
The cubes are carefully dropped, at the same time, into a beaker of dilute 
hydrochloric acid (Figure 1.13).

ACTIVE TRANSPORTDiffusion happens because of the kinetic energy of the particles. It does not 
need an ‘extra’ source of energy from respiration. However, sometimes a cell needs to take in a substance when there is very little of that substance outside the cell, in other words against a concentration gradient. It can do this by another process, called active transport. 
During active transport a cell uses energy from respiration to take up 
substances, rather like a pump uses energy to move a liquid from one place to another. In fact, biologists speak of the cell ‘pumping’ ions or molecules in or out. The pumps are large protein molecules located in the cell membrane, and they are driven by the breakdown of ATP. An example of a place where this happens is in the human small intestine, where some glucose in the gut is absorbed into the cells lining the intestine by active transport. The roots of plants also take up certain mineral ions in this way. Cells use active transport to control the uptake of many substances.
OSMOSISWater moves across cell membranes by a special sort of diffusion, called osmosis. Osmosis happens when the total concentrations of all dissolved substances inside and outside the cell are different. Water will move across the membrane from the more dilute solution to the more concentrated one. Notice that this is still obeying the rules of diffusion – the water moves from where there is a higher concentration of water molecules to a lower concentration of water molecules. Osmosis can only happen if the membrane is permeable to water but not to some other solutes. We say that it is partially permeable.
Osmosis is important for moving water from cell to cell, for example in plant 
roots. You will find out more about osmosis in Chapter 11.
SPECIALISED EXCHANGE SURFACESAll cells exchange substances with their surroundings, but some parts of animals or plants are specially adapted for the exchange of materials because they have a very large surface area in proportion to their volume. In animals, two examples are the alveoli (air sacs) of the lungs (Chapter 3) and the villi of the small intestine (Chapter 4). Diffusion is a slow process, and organs that rely on diffusion need a large surface over which it can take place. The alveoli allow the exchange of oxygen and carbon dioxide to take place between the air and the blood during breathing. The villi of the small intestine provide a large surface area for the absorption of digested food. In plants, exchange surfaces are also adapted by having a large surface area, such as the spongy mesophyll of the leaf (Chapter 10) and the root hairs.
CELLS, TISSUES AND ORGANS
Cells with a similar function are grouped together as tissues. For example, the muscle of your arm contains millions of similar muscle cells, all specialised for one function – contraction to move the arm bones. This is muscle tissue. However, a muscle also contains other tissues, such as blood, nervous tissue and epithelium (lining tissue). A collection of several tissues carrying out a particular function is called an organ. The main organs of the human body are shown in Figure 1.14. Plants also have tissues and organs. Leaves, roots, stems and flowers are all plant organs.
In animals, jobs are usually carried out by several different organs working 
together. This is called an organ system. For example, the digestive system consists of the gut, along with glands such as the pancreas and gall bladder. KEY POINT
Active transport is the movement of 
substances against a concentration gradient, using energy from respiration.
KEY POINT
Osmosis in cells is the net movement 
of water from a dilute solution to a more concentrated solution across the partially permeable cell membrane.
KEY POINT
‘Adapted’ or ‘an adaptation’ means 
that the structure of a cell or an organism is suited to its function. It is a word that is very commonly used in biology, and will appear again in many of the chapters of this book. We also use it when we say that organisms are adapted to their environment.

LOOKING AHEAD – MEMBRANES IN CELLS
If you continue to study biology beyond International GCSE, you will learn 
more about the structure and function of cells. You might like to look on the Internet for some electron micrographs and carry out some further research into cells.
Electron micrographs allow us to see cells at a much greater 
magnification than by using a light microscope. They also reveal more detail. The image produced by a light microscope can only distinguish features about the size of a mitochondrion. The electron microscope has a much greater resolution. Resolution is the ability to distinguish two points in an image as being separate. The maximum resolution of a light microscope is about 200 nanometres (nm), while with an electron microscope we can distinguish structures less than 1
 nm in siz
e. That is 
why ribosomes are only visible using an electron microscope – they are about 25
 nm in diamet
er. A nanometre (nm) is 10–9 m, or one millionth of a 
milimetr
e. 
Electron microscopy reveals that much of the cytoplasm is made up of membranes. As well as the cell surface membrane, there are membranes around organelles such as the nucleus, mitochondria and chloroplasts. In addition, there is an extensive system of membranes running throughout the cytoplasm, called the endoplasmic reticulum (ER). Some ER is covered in ribosomes, and is called rough ER (Figure 1.15). 
rough
endoplasmic
reticulum
▲ Figur e 1.15 Rough endoplasmic reticulum is a system of membranes extending throughout 
the cytoplasm of a cell. It is covered with ribosomes the (tiny dots). Ribosomes are the site 
of protein synthesis.
There are thousands of different chemical reactions that take place inside 
cells. A key function of a cell membrane is to separate cell functions into different compartments so they don’t take place together. For example, the reactions and enzymes of aerobic respiration are kept inside the mitochondria, separate from the rest of the cytoplasm.

2 THE VARIETY OF LIVING ORGANISMS
There is an enormous variety of living organisms. Biologists put them into groups according to their structure and 
function. The members of each group have certain features in common. 
LEARNING OBJECTIVES
◼ Understand the differ ence between eukaryotic and 
prokaryotic organisms
◼ Describe the featur es common to plants and recognise  
examples of flowering plants such as maize, peas  
and beans
◼ Describe the f eatures common to animals and recognise 
examples such as mammals and insects
◼ Describe the f eatures common to fungi and recognise 
examples such as Mucor and yeast
◼ Describe the f eatures common to protoctists and recognise 
examples such as Amoeba, Chlorella and Plasmodium◼ Describe the features common to bacteria and 
recognise examples such as Lactobacillus bulgaricus and Pneumococcus
◼ Describe the features common to viruses and 
recognise examples such as the influenza virus, the HIV virus and the tobacco mosaic virus
◼ Understand the t erm ‘pathogen’ and know that 
pathogens may include fungi, bacteria, protoctists or viruses.
There are more than ten million species of organisms alive on Earth today, 
and many more that once lived on Earth but are now extinct. In order to make sense of this enormous variety biologists classify organisms, putting them into groups. Members of each group are related – they are descended from a common ancestor by the process of evolution (see Chapter 19). This common ancestry is reflected in the similarities of structure and function of the members of a group.
The five major groups of living organisms are plants, animals, fungi, protoctists 
and bacteria.
PLANTS
You will be familiar with flowering plants, such as those shown in Figure 2.1. This group, or kingdom, also contains simpler plants, such as mosses and ferns. All plants are multicellular, which means that their ‘bodies’ are made up of many cells. Their main distinguishing feature is that their cells contain chloroplasts and they carry out photosynthesis – the process that uses light energy to convert simple inorganic molecules such as water and carbon dioxide into complex organic compounds (see Chapter 10). One of these organic compounds is the carbohydrate cellulose, and all plants have cell walls made of this material. 
Plants can make many other organic compounds as a result of photosynthesis. 
One of the first to be made is the storage carbohydrate starch, which is often found inside plant cells. Another is the sugar sucrose, which is transported around the plant and is sometimes stored in fruits and other plant organs. The structure and function of flowering plants is dealt with in Unit 3 of this book.
▲ Figur e 2.1 (a) A pea plant. Its leaves and stem 
cells contain chloroplasts, giving them their

ANIMALS
You will be even more familiar with this kingdom, since it contains the 
species Homo sapiens, i.e. humans! The variety of the animal kingdom is also enormous, including organisms such as sponges, molluscs, worms, starfish, insects and crustaceans, through to larger animals such as fish, amphibians, reptiles, birds and mammals (Figure 2.2). The last five groups are all vertebrates, which means that they have a vertebral column, or backbone. All other animals lack this feature, and are called invertebrates.
(a) (b) (c)
▲ Figur e 2.2 (a) A housefly. (b) A mosquito, feeding on human blood. Houseflies and mosquitoes are both insects, which make up the largest sub-group of 
all the animals. About 60% of all animal species are insects. (c) This high jumper’s movement is coordinated by a complex nervous system.
Animals are also multicellular organisms. Their cells never contain chloroplasts, so they are unable to carry out photosynthesis. Instead, they gain their nutrition by feeding on other animals or plants. Animal cells also lack cell walls, which allows their cells to change shape, an important feature for organisms that need to move from place to place. Movement in animals is achieved in various ways, but often involves coordination by a nervous system (see Chapter 6). Another feature common to most animals is that they store carbohydrate in their cells as a compound called glycogen (see Chapter 4). The structure and function of animals is dealt with in Unit 2 of this book.
FUNGI
Fungi include mushrooms and toadstools, as well as moulds. These groups of fungi are multicellular. Another group of fungi is the yeasts, which are unicellular (made of single cells). Different species of yeasts live everywhere – on the surface of fruits, in soil, water, and even on dust in the air. The yeast powder used for baking contains millions of yeast cells (Figure 2.3). The cells of fungi never contain chloroplasts, so they cannot photosynthesise. Their cells have cell walls, but they are not composed of cellulose (Figure 2.4).

Because fungi have cell walls, they 
were once thought to be plants that had lost their chlorophyll. We now know that their cell wall is not made of cellulose as in plants, but of a different chemical called chitin (the same material that makes up the outside skeleton of insects). There are many ways that fungi are very different from plants (the most obvious is that fungi do not photosynthesise) and they are not closely related to plants at all.

A mushroom or toadstool is the reproductive structure of the organism, called 
a fruiting body (Figure 2.5). Under the soil, the mushroom has many fine thread-like filaments called hyphae (pronounced high-fee). A mould is rather like a mushroom without the fruiting body. It just consists of the network of hyphae (Figure 2.6). The whole network is called a mycelium (pronounced my-sea-lee-um). Moulds feed by absorbing nutrients from dead (or sometimes living) material, so they are found wherever this is present, for example, in soil, rotting leaves or decaying fruit.
If you leave a piece of bread or fruit exposed to the air for a few days, it will 
soon become mouldy. Mould spores carried in the air have landed on the food and grown into a mycelium of hyphae (Figure 2.7).

▲ Figur e 2.7 The structure of a typical mould fungus, the ‘pin mould’ Mucor.
The thread-like hyphae of Mucor have cell walls surrounding their cytoplasm. 
The cytoplasm contains many nuclei. In other words the hyphae are not divided up into separate cells.
When a spore from Mucor lands on the food, a hypha grows out from it. The 
hypha grows and branches again and again, until the mycelium covers the surface of the food. The hyphae secrete digestive enzymes on to the food, breaking it down into soluble substances such as sugars, which are then absorbed by the mould. Eventually, the food is used up and the mould must infect another source of food by producing more spores.
When an organism feeds on dead organic material in this way, and digestion 
takes place outside of the organism, this is called saprotrophic nutrition. Enzymes that are secreted out of cells for this purpose are called extracellular enzymes (see Chapter 1).KEY POINT
The singular of hyphae is hypha.

PROTOCTISTS
Protoctists are sometimes called the ‘dustbin kingdom’, because they are 
a mixed group of organisms that don’t fit into the plants, animals or fungi. Most protoctists are microscopic single-celled organisms (Figure 2.8). Some look like animal cells, such as Amoeba, which lives in pond water. These are known as protozoa. Other protoctists have chloroplasts and carry out photosynthesis, so are more like plants. These are called algae. Most algae are unicellular, but some species such as seaweeds are multicellular and can grow to a great size. Some protoctists are the agents of disease, such as Plasmodium, the organism that causes malaria.

EUKARYOTIC AND PROKARYOTIC ORGANISMS
All the organisms described so far are composed of eukaryotic cells and are known as eukaryotic organisms. ‘Eukaryotic’ means ‘having a nucleus’ – their cells contain a nucleus surrounded by a membrane, along with other membrane bound organelles, such as mitochondria and chloroplasts.
There are also organisms made of simpler cells, which have no nucleus, 
mitochondria or chloroplasts. These are called prokaryotic cells. ‘Prokaryotic’ means ‘before nucleus’. The main forms of prokaryotic organisms are the bacteria.
BACTERIA
Bacteria are small single-celled organisms. Their cells are much smaller than those of eukaryotic organisms and have a much simpler structure. To give you some idea of their size, a typical animal cell might be 10 to 50
 µ
m in diameter 
(1
 µ
m, or one micrometre, is a millionth of a metre). Compared with this, a 
typical bacterium is only 1 to 5
 µ
m in length (Figure 2.9) and its volume is 
thousands of times smaller than that of the animal cell.
There are three basic shapes of bacteria: spheres, rods and spirals, but they all 
have a similar internal structure (Figure 2.10).
All bacteria are surrounded by a cell wall, which protects the bacterium and 
keeps the shape of the cell. Bacterial cell walls are not made of cellulose but a complex compound of sugars and proteins called peptidoglycan. Some species have another layer outside this wall, called a capsule or slime layer. Both give the bacterium extra protection. Underneath the cell wall is the cell membrane, as in other cells. The middle of the cell is made of cytoplasm. Since it is a prokaryotic cell, the bacterium has no nucleus. Instead, its genetic material (DNA) is in a single chromosome, loose in the cytoplasm, forming a circular loop.animal cell

◀ ▲  Figur e 2.10 Structure of bacteria
Some bacteria can swim, and are propelled through water by corkscrew-
like movements of structures called flagella (a single one of these is called a flagellum). However, many bacteria do not have flagella and cannot move by themselves. Other structures present in the cytoplasm include the plasmids. These are small circular rings of DNA, carrying some of the bacterium’s genes. Not all bacteria contain plasmids, although about three-quarters of all known species do. Plasmids have very important uses in genetic engineering (see Chapter 21).
Some bacteria contain a form of chlorophyll in their cytoplasm, and can carry 
out photosynthesis. However, most bacteria feed off other living or dead organisms. Along with the fungi, many bacteria are important decomposers (see Chapter 14), recycling dead organisms and waste products in the soil and elsewhere. Some bacteria are used by humans to make food, such as Lactobacillus bulgaricus, a rod-shaped species used in the production of yoghurt from milk (Figure 2.11). Other species are pathogens, which means that they cause disease (Figure 2.12).
Despite the relatively simple structure of the bacterial cell, it is still a living 
cell that carries out the normal processes of life, such as respiration, feeding, excretion, growth and reproduction. As you have seen, some bacteria can move, and they can also respond to a range of stimuli. For example, they may move towards a source of food, or away from a poisonous chemical. You should think about these features when you compare bacteria with the next group, the much simpler viruses.
VIRUSES
All viruses are parasites, and can only reproduce inside living cells. The cell in which the virus lives is called the host. There are many different types of viruses. Some live in the cells of animals or plants, and there are even viruses which infect bacteria. Viruses are much smaller than bacterial cells: most are between 0.01 and 0.1
 µ
m in diameter (Figure 2.9).
Viruses are not made of cells. A virus particle is very simple. It has no nucleus or cytoplasm, and is composed of a core of genetic material surrounded by a protein coat (Figure 2.13). The genetic material can be either DNA, or a similar chemical called ribonucleic acid (RNA). In either case, the genetic material makes up just a few genes – all that is needed for the virus to reproduce inside its host cell.(a) Some diﬀerent bacterial shapes

KEY POINT
‘Pathogens are organisms that cause 
disease. Many common animal and plant diseases are caused by bacteria or viruses. Most protoctists are free-living, but a few species are pathogens, such as Plasmodium (Figure 2.8). Even some species of fungi can cause disease, e.g. the skin infection called ‘athlete’s foot’ is caused by a mould.

Sometimes a membrane called an envelope may surround a virus particle, but 
the virus does not make this. Instead it is ‘stolen’ from the surface membrane of the host cell.
Viruses do not feed, respire, excrete, move, grow or respond to their 
surroundings. They do not carry out any of the normal ‘characteristics’ of living things except reproduction, and they can only do this parasitically. This is why biologists do not consider viruses to be living organisms. You can think of them as being on the border between an organism and a non-living chemical.
A virus reproduces by entering the host cell and taking over the host’s 
genetic machinery to make more virus particles. After many virus particles have been made, the host cell dies and the particles are released to infect more cells. Many human diseases are caused in this way, such as influenza (‘flu’). Other examples include colds, measles, mumps, polio and rubella (‘German measles’). Of course, the reproduction process does not continue forever. Usually, the body’s immune system destroys the virus and the person recovers. Sometimes, however, a virus cannot be destroyed by the immune system quickly enough, and it may cause permanent damage or death. With other infections, the virus may attack cells of the immune system itself. This is the case with HIV (the Human Immunodeficiency Virus), which causes the illness called AIDS (Acquired Immune Deficiency Syndrome).
Viruses don’t just parasitise animal cells. Some infect plant cells, such as 
the tobacco mosaic virus (Figure 2.14), which interferes with the ability of the tobacco plant to make chloroplasts, causing mottled patches to develop on the leaves (Figure 2.15).

AIDS is not actually a disease but 
a ‘syndrome’. A syndrome is a set of symptoms caused by a medical condition. In the case of HIV, the virus severely damages the person’s immune system, so they are more likely to get other diseases, such as tuberculosis. They may also develop some unusual types of cancer. This collection of different symptoms is referred to as AIDS.

3 BREA THING AND GAS EXCHANGE
LEARNING OBJECTIVES
◼ Describe the structur e of the thorax, including the 
ribs, intercostal muscles, diaphragm, trachea, bronchi, 
bronchioles, alveoli and pleural membranes
◼ Understand the r ole of the intercostal muscles and the 
diaphragm in ventilation
◼ Explain how alveoli ar e adapted for gas exchange 
by diffusion between air in the lungs and blood in capillaries◼ Investigat e breathing in humans, including the release 
of carbon dioxide and the effect of exercise
◼ Understand the biological consequences of smoking in r
elation to the lungs and circulatory system, including 
coronary heart disease.
Cells get their energy by oxidising foods such as glucose, during the process 
called respiration. If cells are to respire aerobically, they need a continuous supply of oxygen from the blood. In addition, carbon dioxide from respiration needs to be removed from the body. In humans, these gases are exchanged between the blood and the air in the lungs. 
RESPIRATION AND BREATHING
You need to understand the difference between respiration and breathing. Respiration is the oxidation reaction that releases energy from foods such as glucose (Chapter 1). Breathing is the mechanism that moves air into and out of the lungs, allowing gas exchange to take place. The lungs and associated structures are often called the ‘respiratory system’ but this can be confusing. It is better to call them the gas exchange system and this is the term we use in this book.
THE STRUCTURE OF THE GAS EXCHANGE SYSTEM
The lungs are enclosed in the chest or thorax by the ribcage and a muscular sheet of tissue called the diaphragm (Figure 3.1). As you will see, the actions of these two structures bring about the movements of air into and out of the lungs. Joining each rib to the next are two sets of muscles called intercostal muscles (‘costals’ are rib bones). The diaphragm separates the contents of the thorax from the abdomen. It is not flat, but a shallow dome shape, with a fibrous middle part forming the ‘roof’ of the dome, and muscular edges forming the walls.When we breathe, air is moved in and out of the lungs so that gas exchange can take place between the air and the blood. 
This chapter looks at these processes, and also deals with some ways that smoking can damage the lungs and stop these vital organs from working properly.

▲ Figur e 3.1 The human gas exchange system
The air passages of the lungs form a highly branching network (Figure 3.2). 
This is why it is sometimes called the bronchial tree.
When we breathe in, air enters our nose or mouth and passes down the 
windpipe or trachea. The trachea splits into two tubes called the bronchi (singular bronchus), one leading to each lung. Each bronchus divides into smaller and smaller tubes called bronchioles, eventually ending at microscopic air sacs, called alveoli (singular alveolus). It is here that gas exchange with the blood takes place.
The walls of trachea and bronchi contain rings of gristle or cartilage. These 
support the airways and keep them open when we breathe in. They are rather like the rings in a vacuum cleaner hose – without them the hose would squash flat when the cleaner sucks air in.
The inside of the thorax is separated from the lungs by two thin, moist 
membranes called the pleural membranes. They make up a continuous envelope around the lungs, forming an airtight seal. Between the two membranes is a space called the pleural cavity, filled with a thin layer of liquid called pleural fluid. This acts as lubrication, so that the surfaces of the lungs don’t stick to the inside of the chest wall when we breathe.
KEEPING THE AIRWAYS CLEANThe trachea and larger airways are lined with a layer of cells that have an important role in keeping the airways clean. Some cells in this lining secrete a sticky liquid called mucus, which traps particles of dirt or bacteria that are breathed in. Other cells are covered with tiny hair-like structures called cilia (Figure 3.4). The cilia beat backward and forward, sweeping the mucus and trapped particles out towards the mouth. In this way, dirt and bacteria are

EXTENSION WORK
In the bronchi, the cartilage forms 
complete, circular rings. In the trachea, the rings are incomplete, and shaped like a letter ‘C’. The open part of the ring is at the back of the trachea, next to where the oesophagus (gullet) lies as it passes through the thorax. When food passes along the oesophagus by peristalsis (see Chapter 4) the gaps in the rings allow the lumps of food to pass through more easily, without the peristaltic wave ‘catching’ on the rings (Figure 3.3).

prevented from entering the lungs, where they might cause an infection. As 
you will see, one of the effects of smoking is that it destroys the cilia and stops this protection mechanism from working properly.
VENTILATION OF THE LUNGS
Ventilation means moving air in and out of the lungs. This requires a difference in air pressure – the air moves from a place where the pressure is high to one where it is low. Ventilation depends on the fact that the thorax is an airtight cavity. When we breathe, we change the volume of our thorax, which alters the pressure inside it. This causes air to move in or out of the lungs. 
There are two movements that bring about ventilation: those of the ribs and 
the diaphragm. If you put your hands on your chest and breathe in deeply, you can feel your ribs move upwards and outwards. They are moved by the intercostal muscles (Figure 3.5). The outer (external) intercostals contract, pulling the ribs up. At the same time, the muscles of the diaphragm contract, pulling the diaphragm down into a more flattened shape (Figure 3.6a). Both these movements increase the volume of the chest and cause a slight drop in pressure inside the thorax compared with the air outside. Air then enters the lungs (inhalation). 
The opposite happens when you breathe out deeply. The external intercostals 
relax, and the internal intercostals contract, pulling the ribs down and in. At the same time, the diaphragm muscles relax and the diaphragm goes back to its normal dome shape. The volume of the thorax decreases, and the pressure in the thorax is raised slightly above atmospheric pressure. This time the difference in pressure forces air out of the lungs (Figure 3.6b). Exhalation is helped by the fact that the lungs are elastic, so that they have a tendency to collapse and empty like a balloon.

▲ Figur e 3.4 This electron microscope picture 
shows cilia from the lining of the trachea.
EXTENSION WORK
During normal (shallow) breathing, 
the elasticity of the lungs and the weight of the ribs acting downwards is enough to cause exhalation. The internal intercostals are only really used for deep (forced) breathing out, for instance when we are exercising.

KEY POINT
It is important that you remember the changes in volume and pressure during 
ventilation. If you have trouble understanding these, think of what happens when you use a bicycle pump. If you push the pump handle, the air in the pump is squashed, its pressure rises and it is forced out of the pump. If you pull on the handle, the air pressure inside the pump falls a little, and air is drawn in from outside. This is similar to what happens in the lungs. In exams, students sometimes talk about the lungs forcing the air in and out – they don’t!
GAS EXCHANGE IN THE ALVEOLI
You can tell what is happening during gas exchange if you compare the amounts 
of different gases in atmospheric air with the air breathed out (Table 3.1).
Table 3.1 Approximate percentage volume of gases in atmospheric (inhaled) and exhaled air.
Gas Atmospheric air / % Exhaled air / %
nitrogen 78 79
oxygen 21 16
carbon dioxide 0.04 4
other gases (mainly argon) 1 1
Exhaled air is also warmer than atmospheric air, and is saturated with water vapour. The amount of water vapour in the atmosphere varies depending on weather conditions.
Clearly, the lungs are absorbing oxygen into the blood and removing carbon 
dioxide from it. This happens in the alveoli. To do this efficiently, the alveoli must have a structure which brings the air and blood very close together, over a very large surface area. There are enormous numbers of alveoli. It has been calculated that the two lungs contain about 700
 000
 000 of these tiny air sacs, giving a t
otal 
surface area of 60
 m2. That’s bigger than the floor area of an average classroom! 
Viewed through a high-powered microscope, the alveoli look rather like bunches of grapes, and are covered with tiny blood capillaries (Figure 3.7).HINT
Be careful when interpreting 
percentages! The percentage of a gas in a mixture can vary, even if the actual amount of the gas stays the same. This is easiest to understand from an example. Imagine you have a bottle containing a mixture of 20% oxygen and 80% nitrogen. If you used a chemical to absorb all the oxygen in the bottle, the nitrogen left would now be 100% of the gas in the bottle, despite the fact that the amount of nitrogen would still be the same. That is why the percentage of nitrogen in inhaled and exhaled air is slightly different.

▲ Figur e 3.7 (a) Alveoli and the surrounding capillary network. (b) Diffusion of oxygen and carbon dioxide takes place between the air in the 
alveolus and the blood in the capillaries.
Deoxygenated blood is pumped from the heart to the lungs and passes 
through the capillaries surrounding the alveoli. The blood has come from the respiring tissues of the body, where it has given up some of its oxygen to the cells, and gained carbon dioxide. Around the lungs, the blood is separated from the air inside each alveolus by only two cell layers; the cells making up the wall of the alveolus, and the capillary wall itself. This is a distance of less than a thousandth of a millimetre.
EXTENSION WORK
The thin layer of fluid lining the inside of the alveoli comes from the blood. The 
capillaries and cells of the alveolar wall are ‘leaky’ and the blood pressure pushes fluid out from the blood plasma into the alveolus. Oxygen dissolves in this moist surface before it passes through the alveolar wall into the blood.
Because the air in the alveolus has a higher concentration of oxygen than the 
blood entering the capillary network, oxygen diffuses from the air, across the wall of the alveolus and into the blood. At the same time there is more carbon dioxide in the blood than there is in the air in the lungs. This means that there is a diffusion gradient for carbon dioxide in the other direction, so carbon dioxide diffuses the other way, out of the blood and into the alveolus. The result is that the blood which leaves the capillaries and flows back to the heart has gained oxygen and lost carbon dioxide. The heart then pumps the oxygenated blood around the body again, to supply the respiring cells (see Chapter 5).HINT
Be careful – students sometimes write 
‘The alveolus has cell walls’. This statement is not correct – a cell wall is part of a plant cell! The correct way to describe the structure is: ‘The alveolus has a wall made of cells’.

▼ PRAC TICAL: COMPARING THE CARBON DIOXIDE CONTENT 
OF INHALED AND EXHALED AIR
The apparatus in Figure 3.8 can be used to compare the amount of 
carbon dioxide in inhaled and exhaled air. A person breathes gently in and out through the middle tube. Exhaled air passes out through one tube of indicator solution and inhaled air is drawn in through the other tube. If limewater is used, the limewater in the ‘exhaled’ tube will turn cloudy before the limewater in the ‘inhaled’ tube. (If hydrogen carbonate indicator solution is used instead, it changes from red to yellow.)

ACTIVITY 2
▼ PRAC TICAL: AN INVESTIGATION INTO THE EFFECT OF 
EXERCISE ON BREATHING RATE
It is easy to show the effect of exercise on a person’s breathing rate. They sit quietly for five minutes, making sure that they are completely relaxed. They then count the number of breaths they take in one minute, recording their results in a table. They wait a minute, and then count their breaths again, recording the result, and repeating if necessary until they get a steady value for the ‘resting rate’.
The person then carries out some vigorous exercise, such as running on 
the spot for three minutes. Immediately after they finish the exercise, they sit down and record the breathing rate as before. They then continue to record their breaths per minute, every minute, until they return to their normal resting rate.Safety note: Wear eye protection and 
breathe gently; do not blow. A clean mouthpiece must be used for each person.!
Safety note: Wear suitable footwear for exercising and if doing step-ups use a sturdy secure low box or a PE bench.!

THE EFFECTS OF SMOKING
In order for the lungs to exchange gases properly, the air passages need to be clear, the alveoli need to be free from dirt particles and bacteria, and they must have as big a surface area as possible in contact with the blood. There is one habit that can upset all of these conditions – smoking.
Links between smoking and diseases of the lungs are now a proven fact. 
Smoking is associated with lung cancer, bronchitis and emphysema. It is also a major contributing factor to other conditions, such as coronary heart disease and ulcers of the stomach and intestine. Pregnant women who smoke are more likely to give birth to underweight babies. 
Coronary heart disease will be described in Chapter 5 after you have studied 
the structure of the heart. Here we will look at a number of other medical conditions that are caused by smoking.
EFFECTS OF SMOKE ON THE LINING 
OF THE AIR PASSAGESYou saw above how the lungs are kept free of particles of dirt and bacteria by 
the action of mucus and cilia. In the trachea and bronchi of a smoker, the cilia are destroyed by the chemicals in cigarette smoke. 
Uncorrected proof, all content subject to change at publisher discretion. Not for resale, circulation or distribution in whole or in part. ©Pearson 201942 ANIMAL PHYSIOLOGY BREATHING AND GAS EXCHANGE
The reduced numbers of cilia mean that the mucus is not swept away from the 
lungs, but remains to block the air passages. This is made worse by the fact that the smoke irritates the lining of the airways, stimulating the cells to secrete more mucus. The sticky mucus blocking the airways is the source of ‘smoker’s cough’. Irritation of the bronchial tree, along with infections from bacteria in the mucus, can cause the lung disease bronchitis. Bronchitis blocks normal air flow, so the sufferer has difficulty breathing properly.
EMPHYSEMAEmphysema is another lung disease that kills about 20  000 people in Britain 
ever
y year. Smoking is the cause of one type of emphysema. Smoke damages 
the walls of the alveoli, which break down and fuse together again, forming enlarged, irregular air spaces (Figure 3.9). 
This greatly reduces the surface area for gas exchange, which becomes  
very inefficient. The blood of a person with emphysema carries less oxygen.  In serious cases, this leads to the sufferer being unable to carry out even  mild exercise, such as walking. Emphysema patients often have to have a supply of oxygen nearby at all times (Figure 3.10). There is no cure for emphysema, and usually the sufferer dies after a long and distressing  illness.

LUNG CANCEREvidence of the link between smoking and lung cancer first appeared in the 
1950s. In one study, a number of patients in hospital were given a series of questions about their lifestyles. They were asked about their work, hobbies, housing and so on, including a question about how many cigarettes they smoked. The same questionnaire was given to two groups of patients. The first group were all suffering from lung cancer. The second (Control) group were in hospital with various other illnesses, but not lung cancer. To make it a fair comparison, the Control patients were matched with the lung cancer patients for sex, age and so on.
When the results were compared, one difference stood out (Table 3.2). 
A greater proportion of the lung cancer patients were smokers than in the Control patients. There seemed to be a connection between smoking and getting lung cancer. EXTENSION WORK
A person who has chronic (long-term) 
bronchitis and emphysema is said to be suffering from chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, or COPD. COPD is a progressive disease for which there is no cure.

Although the results didn’t prove that smoking caused lung cancer, there was 
a statistically significant link between smoking and the disease: this is called a ‘correlation’. 
Over 20 similar investigations in nine countries have revealed the same 
findings. In 1962 a report called ‘Smoking and health’ was published by the Royal College of Physicians of London, which warned the public about the dangers of smoking. Not surprisingly, the first people to take the findings seriously were doctors, many of whom stopped smoking. This was reflected in their death rates from lung cancer. In ten years, while deaths among the general male population had risen by 7%, the deaths of male doctors from the disease had fallen by 38%.
Cigarette smoke contains a strongly addictive drug – nicotine. Smoke 
contains over 7000 chemicals, including; carbon monoxide, arsenic, ammonia, formaldehyde, cyanide, benzene, and toluene. More than 60 of the chemicals are known to cause cancer. These chemicals are called carcinogens, and are contained in the tar that collects in a smoker’s lungs. Cancer happens when cells mutate and start to divide uncontrollably, forming a tumour (Figure 3.11). If a lung cancer patient is lucky, they may have the tumour removed by an operation before the cancer cells spread to other tissues of the body. Unfortunately tumours in the lungs usually cause no pain, so they are not discovered until it is too late – it may be inoperable, or tumours may have developed elsewhere.
If you smoke you are not bound to get lung cancer, but the risk that you will 
get it is much greater. In fact, the more cigarettes you smoke, the more the risk increases (Figure 3.12).

▲ Figur e 3.12 The more cigarettes a person smokes, the more likely it is they will die of lung cancer. 
For example, smoking 20 cigarettes a day increases the risk by about 15 times.
The obvious thing to do is not to start smoking. However, if you are a smoker, 
giving up the habit soon improves your chance of survival (Figure 3.13). After a few years, the likelihood of your dying from a smoking-related disease is almost back to the level of a non-smoker.

People often talk about ‘yellow 
nicotine stains’ . In fact it is the tar that stains a smoker’s fingers and teeth. Nicotine is a colourless, odourless chemical.
DID YOU KNOW?
Studies have shown that the type of cigarette smoked makes very little difference to the smoker’s risk of getting lung cancer. Filtered and ‘low tar’ cigarettes only reduce the risk slightly.

CARBON MONOXIDE IN SMOKEOne of the harmful chemicals in cigarette smoke is the poisonous gas 
carbon monoxide. When this gas is breathed in with the smoke, it enters the bloodstream and interferes with the ability of the blood to carry oxygen. Oxygen is carried around in the blood in the red blood cells, attached to a chemical called haemoglobin (see Chapter 5). Carbon monoxide can combine with the haemoglobin much more tightly than oxygen can, forming a compound called carboxyhaemoglobin. The haemoglobin will combine with carbon monoxide in preference to oxygen. When this happens, the blood carries much less oxygen around the body. Carbon monoxide from smoking is also a major cause of heart disease (Chapter 5). 
If a pregnant woman smokes, she will be depriving her unborn fetus of oxygen 
(Figure 3.14). This has an effect on its growth and development, and leads to the mass of the baby at birth being lower, on average, than the mass of babies born to non-smokers. 
SOME SMOKING STATISTICS
 ◾It is estimat ed that there are over 1 billion smokers worldwide. In 2014 they 
consumed 5.8 trillion cigarettes.
 ◾E
very year nearly 6 million people are killed by tobacco-related illnesses. If 
the current trend continues, by 2030 this will rise to 8 million deaths per year and 80% of these premature deaths will be in developing countries.
 ◾Smoking causes almost 80% of deaths fr
om lung cancer, 80% of deaths 
from bronchitis and emphysema, and 14% of deaths from heart disease.
 ◾Mor
e than a quarter of all cancer deaths are attributable to smoking. These 
include cancer of the lung, mouth, lip, throat, bladder, kidney, pancreas, stomach, liver and cervix.
 ◾While demand for t
obacco has steadily fallen in developed countries like 
the UK, cigarette consumption is being increasingly concentrated in the developing world.
 ◾9.6 million adults in the UK smok
e cigarettes, 20% of men and 17% of 
women. However, 22% of women and 30% of men in the UK are now ex
-
smokers. Surveys show that about two-thirds of current smokers would 
like to stop smoking. 
 ◾It is estimat
ed that worldwide, 31% of men and 8% of women are smokers. 
Consumption varies widely between different countries, but generally the areas of the world where there has been no change in consumption, or an increase, are southern and central Asia, Eastern Europe and Africa.

 ◾In China alone ther e are about 350 million smokers, who consume about 
one-third of all cigarettes smoked worldwide. Large multinational tobacco 
companies have long been keen to enter the Chinese market.
 ◾In China ther
e are over a million deaths a year from smoking-related 
diseases. This figure is expected to double by 2025.
 ◾In developing countries, smoking has a gr
eater economic impact. Poorer 
smokers spend significant amounts of their income on cigarettes rather than necessities like food, healthcare and education.
 ◾T
obacco farming uses up land that could be used for growing food crops. 
In 2012, 7.5 million tonnes of tobacco leaf were grown on almost 4.3 million hectares of land (an area larger than Switzerland).

GIVING UP SMOKINGMost smokers admit that they would like to find a way to give up the habit. 
The trouble is that the nicotine in tobacco is a very addictive drug, and causes withdrawal symptoms when people stop smoking. These include cravings for a cigarette, restlessness and a tendency to put on weight (nicotine depresses the appetite).
There are various ways that smokers can be helped to give up their habit. One 
method is ‘vaping’, which involves inhaling a vapour containing nicotine from an electronic cigarette or e-cigarette (Figure 3.15). Other methods use nicotine patches (Figure 3.16) or nicotine chewing gum. They all work in a similar way, providing the smoker with a source of nicotine without the harmful tar from cigarettes. The nicotine is absorbed by the body and reduces the craving for a cigarette. Gradually, the patient reduces the nicotine dose until they are weaned off the habit.
EXTENSION WORK
You could carry out an Internet search to find out about the different methods people 
use to help them give up smoking. Which methods have the highest success rate? Is there any evidence that suggests e-cigarettes are not safe?
There are several other ways that people use to help them give up smoking, 
including the use of drugs that reduce withdrawal symptoms, acupuncture and even hypnotism.

6 A student wr ote the following about the lungs.
When we breathe in, our lungs inflate, sucking air in and pushing the ribs 
up and out, and forcing the diaphragm down. This is called respiration. In the air sacs of the lungs, the air enters the blood. The blood then takes the air around the body, where it is used by the cells. The blood returns to the lungs to be cleaned. When we breathe out, our lungs deflate, pulling the diaphragm up and the ribs down. The stale air is pushed out of the lungs.

4 FOOD AND DIGESTION
Food is essential for life. The nutrients obtained from it are used in many different ways by the body. This chapter looks at 
the different kinds of food, and how the food is broken down by the digestive system and absorbed into the blood, so that it can be carried to all the tissues of the body. 
LEARNING OBJECTIVES

carbohydrates, proteins and lipids (fats and oils)
◼ Describe the structur e of carbohydrates, proteins 
and lipids as large molecules made up from smaller basic units – starch and glycogen from simple sugars, protein from amino acids, and lipids from fatty acids and glycerol
◼ Investigat e food samples for the presence of glucose, 
starch, protein and fat
◼ Understand that a balanced diet should include  
appropriate proportions of carbohydrate, protein, lipid, vitamins, minerals, water and dietary fibre

levels, age and pregnancy◼ Describe the structur e and function of the human 
alimentary canal, including the mouth, oesophagus, stomach, small intestine (duodenum and ileum), large intestine (colon and rectum) and pancreas
◼ Understand how food is moved thr ough the gut by 
peristalsis
◼ Understand the r ole of digestive enzymes, including 
the digestion of starch to glucose by amylase and maltase, the digestion of proteins to amino acids by proteases and the digestion of lipids to fatty acids and glycerol by lipases
◼ Understand that bile is pr oduced by the liver and stored 
in the gall bladder, and understand the role of bile in  neutralising stomach acid and emulsifying lipids
◼ Understand how the small int estine is adapted for 
absorption, including the structure of a villus
We need food for three main reasons:
 ◾t
o supply us with a ‘fuel’ for energy
 ◾t
o provide materials for growth and repair of tissues
 ◾t
o help fight disease and keep our bodies healthy.
A BALANCED DIET
The food that we eat is called our diet. No matter what you like to eat, your diet 
must include the following five groups of food substances if your body is to work properly and stay healthy – carbohydrates, lipids, proteins, minerals and vitamins – along with dietary fibre and water. Food should provide you with all of these substances, but they must also be present in the right amounts. A diet that provides enough of these substances and in the correct proportions to keep you healthy is called a balanced diet (Figure 4.1). We will look at each type of food in turn, to find out about its chemistry and the role that it plays in the body.
▲ Figur e 4.1 A balanced diet contains all the 
types of food the body needs, in just the right 
amounts.

CARBOHYDRATESCarbohydrates only make up about 1% of the mass of the human body, but 
they have a very important role. They are the body’s main ‘fuel’ for supplying cells with energy. Cells release this energy by oxidising a sugar called glucose, in the process called cell respiration (see Chapter 1). Glucose and other sugars belong to one group of carbohydrates.
Glucose is found naturally in many sweet-tasting foods, such as fruits and 
vegetables. Other foods contain different sugars, such as the fruit sugar called fructose, and the milk sugar, lactose. Ordinary table sugar, the sort some people put in their tea or coffee, is called sucrose. Sucrose is the main sugar that is transported through plant stems. This is why we can extract it from sugar cane, which is the stem of a large grass-like plant. Sugars have two physical properties that you will probably know: they all taste sweet, and they are all soluble in water.
We can get all the sugar we need from natural foods such as fruits and vegetables, 
and from the digestion of starch. Many processed foods contain large amounts of added sugar. For example, a typical can of cola can contain up to seven 
teaspoons (27
 g) of sugar! Ther
e is hidden sugar in many other foods. A tin of 
baked beans contains about 10
 g of added sugar
. This is on top of all the food that 
we eat with a more obvious sugar content, such as cakes, biscuits and sweets. 
In fact, we get most of the carbohydrate in our diet not from sugars, but from 
starch. Starch is a large, insoluble molecule. Because it does not dissolve, it is found as a storage carbohydrate in many plants, such as potato, rice, wheat and millet. The ‘staple diets’ of people from around the world are starchy foods like rice, potatoes, bread and pasta. Starch is a polymer of glucose – it is made of long chains of hundreds of glucose molecules joined together (Figure 4.2).
Starch is only found in plant tissues, but animal cells sometimes contain a very 
similar carbohydrate called glycogen. This is also a polymer of glucose, and is found in tissues such as liver and muscle, where it acts as a store of energy for these organs.
As you will see, large carbohydrates such as starch and glycogen have to 
be broken down into simple sugars during digestion, so that they can be absorbed into the blood.
Another carbohydrate that is a polymer of glucose is cellulose, the material 
that makes up plant cell walls. Humans are not able to digest cellulose, because our gut doesn’t make the enzyme needed to break down the cellulose molecule. This means that we are not able to use cellulose as a source of energy. However, it still has a vitally important function in our diet. It forms dietary fibre or ‘roughage’, which gives the muscles of the gut something to push against as the food is moved through the intestine. This keeps the gut contents moving, avoiding constipation and helping to prevent serious diseases of the intestine, such as colitis and bowel cancer.
EXTENSION WORK
‘Single’ sugars such as glucose and fructose are called monosaccharides. Sucrose 
molecules are made of two monosaccharides (glucose and fructose) joined together, so sucrose is called a disaccharide. Lactose is also a disaccharide, made of glucose joined to another monosaccharide called galactose. Polymers of sugars, such as starch, glycogen and cellulose, are called polysaccharides.
LIPIDS (FATS AND OILS)Lipids contain the same three elements as carbohydrates – carbon, hydrogen 
and oxygen – but the proportion of oxygen in a lipid is much lower than in a carbohydrate. For example, beef and lamb both contain a fat called tristearin, which has the formula C
51H98O6. This fat, like other animal fats, is a solid at room DID YOU KNOW?
The chemical formula for 
glucose is C6H12O6. Like all 
carbohydrates, glucose contains only the elements carbon, hydrogen and oxygen. The ‘carbo’ part of the name refers to carbon, and the ‘hydrate’ part refers to the fact that the hydrogen and oxygen atoms are in the ratio two to one, as in water (H
2O).

temperature, but melts if you warm it up. On the other hand, plant lipids are 
usually liquid at room temperature, and are called oils. Meat, butter, cheese, milk, eggs and oily fish are all rich in animal fats, as well as foods fried in animal fat. Vegetable oils include many types used for cooking, such as olive oil, corn oil and rapeseed oil, as well as products made from oils, such as margarine (Figure 4.3).
Lipids make up about 10% of our body’s mass. They form an essential part 
of the structure of all cells, and fat is deposited in certain parts of the body as a long-term store of energy, for example under the skin and around the heart and kidneys. The fat layer under the skin acts as insulation, reducing heat loss through the surface of the body. Fat around organs such as the kidneys also helps to protect them from mechanical damage.
The chemical ‘building blocks’ of lipids are two types of molecule called 
glycerol and fatty acids. Glycerol is an oily liquid. It is also known as glycerine, and is used in many types of cosmetics. In lipids, a molecule of glycerol is joined to three fatty acid molecules. There are many different fatty acid molecules, which give us the many different kinds of lipid found in food (Figure 4.4).
Although lipids are an essential part of our diet, too much lipid is unhealthy, 
especially a type called saturated fat, and a lipid compound called cholesterol. These substances have been linked to heart disease (see Chapter 5).
DID YOU KNOW?
Saturated lipids (saturated fats) are more common in food from animal 
sources, such as meat and dairy products. ‘Saturated’ is a word used in chemistry, which means that the fatty acids of the lipids contain no double bonds. Other lipids are unsaturated, which means that their fatty acids contain double bonds. These are more common in plant oils. There is evidence that unsaturated lipids are healthier for us than saturated ones. 
PROTEINSProteins make up about 18% of the mass of the body. This is the second 
largest percentage after water. All cells contain protein, so we need it for growth and repair of tissues. Many compounds in the body are made from protein, including enzymes. 
Most foods contain some protein, but certain foods such as meat, fish, cheese 
and eggs are particularly rich in it. You will notice that these foods are animal products. Plant material generally contains less protein, but some foods, especially beans, peas and nuts, are richer in protein than others. 
However, we don’t need much protein in our diet to stay healthy. Doctors 
recommend a maximum daily intake of about 70
 g. In mor
e economically 
developed countries, people often eat far more protein than they need, whereas in many poorer countries a protein-deficiency disease called kwashiorkor is common (Figure 4.5).
Like starch, proteins are also polymers, but whereas starch is made from 
a single molecular building block (glucose), proteins are made from 20 different sub-units called amino acids. All amino acids contain four chemical elements: carbon, hydrogen and oxygen (as in carbohydrates and fats) along with nitrogen. Two amino acids also contain sulfur. The amino acids are linked together in long chains, which are usually folded up or twisted into spirals, with cross-links holding the chains together (Figure 4.6).▲

body gets from food such as eggs and meat, but we also make cholesterol in our liver. It is an essential part of all cells, but too much cholesterol causes heart disease.

is made of a long chain of amino acids arranged in a particular order and folded into a specific shape.
The shape of a protein is very important in allowing it to carry out its function, 
and the order of amino acids in the protein decides its shape. Because there are 20 different amino acids, and they can be arranged in any order, the number of different protein structures that can be made is enormous. As a result, there are thousands of different kinds of proteins in organisms, from structural proteins such as collagen and keratin in skin and nails, to proteins with more specific functions, such as enzymes and haemoglobin.
MINERALSAll the foods you have read about so far are made from just five chemical elements: carbon, hydrogen, oxygen, nitrogen and sulfur. Our bodies contain many other elements that we get from our food as ‘minerals’ or ‘mineral ions’. Some are present in large amounts in the body, for example calcium, which is used for making teeth and bones. Others are present in much smaller amounts, but still have essential jobs to do. For instance our bodies contain about 3
 g of ir
on, but without it our blood would not be able to carry oxygen. 
Table 4.1 shows just a few of these minerals and the reasons they are needed.

Humans can make about half of the 
20 amino acids that they need, but the other 10 have to be taken in as part of the diet. These 10 are called essential amino acids. There are higher amounts of essential amino acids in meat, fish, eggs and dairy products. If you are a vegetarian, you can still get all the essential amino acids you need, as long as you eat a varied diet that includes a range of different plant materials.

If a person doesn’t get enough of a mineral from their diet, they will show the 
symptoms of a ‘mineral deficiency disease’. For example, a one-year-old child needs to consume about 0.6
 g (600
 mg) of calcium ever
y day, to make the 
bones grow properly and harden. Anything less than this over a prolonged period could result in poor bone development. The bones become deformed, a disease called rickets (Figure 4.7). Rickets can also be caused by lack of vitamin D in the diet (see below).
Similarly, 16-year-olds need about 12
 mg of ir
on in their daily food intake. 
If they don’t get this amount, they can’t make enough haemoglobin for their 
red blood cells (see Chapter 5). This causes a condition called anaemia. People who are anaemic become tired and lack energy, because their blood doesn’t carry enough oxygen. 
VITAMINSDuring the early part of the twentieth century, experiments were carried out that identified another class of food substances. When young laboratory rats were fed a diet of pure carbohydrate, lipid and protein, they all became ill and died. If they were fed on the same pure foods with a little added milk, they grew normally. The milk contained chemicals that the rats needed in small amounts to stay healthy. These chemicals are called vitamins. The results of one of these experiments are shown in Figure 4.8.

▲ Figur e 4.8 Rats were fed a diet of pure carbohydrate, lipid and protein, with and without added 
milk. Vitamins in the milk had a dramatic effect on their growth. 
At first, the chemical nature of vitamins was not known, and they were given 
letters to distinguish between them, such as vitamin A, vitamin B and so on. Each was identified by the effect a lack of the vitamin (vitamin deficiency) had on the body. For example, vitamin D is needed for growing bones to take up calcium salts. A deficiency of this vitamin can result in rickets (Figure 4.7), just as a lack of calcium can.
We now know the chemical structure of the vitamins and the exact ways in 
which they work in the body. As with vitamin D, each has a particular function. Vitamin A is needed to make a light-sensitive chemical in the retina of the eye (see Chapter 6). A lack of this vitamin causes night blindness, where the

person finds it difficult to see in dim light. Vitamin C is needed to make fibres 
of a material called connective tissue. This acts as a ‘glue’, bonding cells together in a tissue. It is found in the walls of blood vessels and in the skin and lining surfaces of the body. Vitamin C deficiency leads to a disease called scurvy, where wounds fail to heal, and bleeding occurs in various places in the body. This is especially noticeable in the gums (Figure 4.9).
▲ Figur e 4.9 Vitamin C helps lining cells such as those in the mouth and gums stick to each other. 
Lack of vitamin C causes scurvy, where the mouth and gums become damaged and bleed.
Vitamin B is not a single substance, but a collection of many different substances called the vitamin B group. It includes vitamins B1 (thiamine), B2 (riboflavin) and B3 (niacin). These compounds are involved in the process of cell respiration. Different deficiency diseases result if any of them are missing from the diet. For example, lack of vitamin B1 results in the weakening of the muscles and paralysis, a disease called beri-beri.
The main vitamins, their role in the body and some foods which are good 
sources of each, are summarised in Table 4.2.
Notice that the amounts of vitamins that we need are very small, but we 
cannot stay healthy without them.

FOOD TESTSIt is possible to carry out simple chemical tests to find out if a food contains 
starch, glucose, protein or lipid. Practical 8 uses pure substances for the tests, but it is possible to do them on normal foods too. Unless the food is a liquid like milk, it needs to be cut up into small pieces and ground with a pestle and mortar, then shaken with some water in a test tube. This is done to extract the components of the food and dissolve any soluble substances such as sugars.DID YOU KNOW?
The cure for scurvy was 
discovered as long ago as 1753. Sailors on long voyages often got scurvy because they ate very little fresh fruit and vegetables (the main source of vitamin C). A ship’s doctor called James Lind wrote an account of how the disease could quickly be cured by eating fresh oranges and lemons. The famous explorer Captain Cook, on his world voyages in 1772 and 1775, kept his sailors healthy by making sure that they ate fresh fruit. By 1804, all British sailors were made to drink lime juice to prevent scurvy. This is how they came to be called ‘limeys’ , a word that was later used by Americans for all British people.

ACTIVITY 3
▼ PRAC TICAL: TEST FOR STARCH
A little starch is placed on a spotting tile. A drop of yellow-brown iodine 
solution is added to the starch. The iodine reacts with the starch, forming a very dark blue, or ‘blue-black’ colour (Figure 4.10 (a)
 ). S
tarch 
is insoluble, but this test will work on a solid sample of food, such as potato, or a suspension of starch in water.
▼ PRAC TICAL: TEST FOR GLUCOSE
Glucose is called a reducing sugar. This is because the test for glucose involves reducing an alkaline solution of copper (II) sulfate to copper (I) oxide.
A small spatula measure of glucose is placed in a test tube and a little water added (about 2
 cm deep). The tube is shak
en to dissolve the 
glucose. Several drops of Benedict’s solution are added to the tube, enough to colour the mixture blue (Figure 4.10 (b)
 ).
A wat
er bath is prepared by half-filling a beaker with water and heating 
it on a tripod and gauze. The test tube is placed in the beaker and the water allowed to boil (using a water bath is safer than heating the tube directly in the Bunsen burner). After a few seconds the clear blue solution gradually changes colour, forming a cloudy orange or ‘brick red’ precipitate of copper (I) oxide (Figure 4.10 (b)
 ).
All other ‘single’ sugars (monosaccharides), such as fruct
ose, are 
reducing sugars, as well as some ‘double’ sugars (disaccharides), such as the milk sugar, lactose. However, ordinary table sugar (sucrose) is not. If sucrose is boiled with Benedict’s solution it will stay a clear blue colour.
▼ PRAC TICAL: TEST FOR PROTEIN
The test for protein is sometimes called the ‘biuret’ test, after the coloured compound that is formed.
A little protein, such as powdered egg white (albumen), is placed in a test 
tube and about 2
 cm depth of wat
er added. The tube is shaken to mix 
the powder with the water. An equal volume of dilute (5%) potassium hydroxide solution is added and the tube shaken again. Finally two drops of 1% copper sulfate solution are added. A purple colour develops. (Sometimes these two solutions are supplied already mixed together as ‘biuret solution’.)
▼ PRAC TICAL: TEST FOR LIPID
Fats and oils are insoluble in water, but will dissolve in ethanol (alcohol). The test for lipid uses this fact.
A pipette is used to place one drop of olive oil in the bottom of a test tube. 
About 2
 cm depth of ethanol is added, and the tube is shak
en to dissolve 
the oil. The solution is poured into a test tube that is about three-quarters full with cold water. A white cloudy layer forms on the top of the water. The white layer is caused by the ethanol dissolving in the water and leaving the lipid behind as a suspension of tiny droplets, called an emulsion.▲

▲ Figur e 4.11 Food packaging is labelled with the proportions of different food types that it contains, 
along with its energy content. The energy in units called kilocalories (kcal) is also shown, but 
scientists no longer use this old-fashioned unit.
ENERGY FROM FOOD
Some foods contain more energy than others. It depends on the proportions 
of carbohydrate, lipid and protein that they contain. Their energy content is measured in kilojoules (kJ). If a gram of carbohydrate is fully oxidised, it produces about 17
 kJ, wher
eas a gram of lipid yields over twice as much as 
this (39
 kJ). P
rotein can produce about 18
 kJ per gr
am. If you look on a food 
label, it usually shows the energy content of the food, along with the amounts of different nutrients that it contains (Figure 4.11).
Foods with a high percentage of lipid, such as butter or nuts, contain a 
large amount of energy. Others, like fruits and vegetables, which are mainly composed of water, have a much lower energy content (Table 4.3).

EXTENSION WORK
Food scientists measure the amount of energy in a sample of food by burning it in a 
calorimeter (Figure 4.12). The calorimeter is filled with oxygen, to make sure that the food will burn easily. A heating filament carrying an electrical current ignites the food. The energy given out by the burning food is measured by using it to heat up water flowing through a coil in the calorimeter.

▶ Figur e 4.12 A food calorimeter 
If you have samples of food that will easily burn in air, you can measure the energy in 
them by a similar method, using the heat from the burning food to warm up water in a test tube.
Even while you are asleep you need a supply of energy – in order to keep 
warm, for your heart to keep beating, to allow messages to be sent through your nerves, and for other body functions. However, the energy you need at other times depends on the physical work you do. The total amount of energy that a person needs to keep healthy depends on their age and body size, and also on the amount of activity they do. Table 4.4 shows some examples of how much energy is needed each day by people of different age, sex and occupation.
Remember that these are approximate figures, and they are averages. 
Generally, the greater a person’s weight, the more energy that person needs. This is why men, with a greater average body mass, need more energy than women. The energy needs of a pregnant woman are increased, mainly because of the extra weight that she has to carry. A heavy manual worker, such as a labourer, needs extra energy for increased muscle activity.
It is not only the recommended energy requirements that vary with age, 
sex and pregnancy, but also the content of the diet. For instance, during pregnancy a woman may need extra iron or calcium in her diet, for the growth of the fetus. In younger women, the blood loss during menstruation (periods) can result in anaemia, producing a need for extra iron in the diet.
DIGESTION
Food, such as a piece of bread, contains carbohydrates, lipids and proteins, 
but they are not the same carbohydrates, lipids and proteins as in our tissues. The components of the bread must first be broken down into their ‘building blocks’ before they can be absorbed through the wall of the gut. This process is called digestion. The digested molecules – sugars, fatty acids, glycerol and amino acids – along with minerals, vitamins and water, can then be carried around the body in the blood. When they reach the tissues they are reassembled into the molecules that make up our cells.Table 4.4 The daily energy needs of different 
types of people.

Digestion is speeded up by enzymes, which are biological catalysts (see 
Chapter 1). Although most enzymes stay inside cells, the digestive enzymes are made by the tissues and glands in the gut and pass out of cells – on to the gut contents where they act on the food. This chemical digestion is helped by mechanical digestion. Mechanical digestion is the physical breakdown of food. The most obvious place where this happens is in the mouth, where the teeth bite and chew the food, cutting it into smaller pieces that have a larger surface area. This means that enzymes can act on the food more quickly. Other parts of the gut also help with mechanical digestion. For example, muscles in the wall of the stomach contract to churn up the food while it is being chemically digested.
PERISTALSIS
Muscles are also responsible for moving the food along the gut. The walls of the intestine contain two layers of muscles. One layer has fibres arranged in rings around the gut. This is the circular muscle layer. The other has fibres running along the length of the gut, and is called the longitudinal muscle layer. Together these two layers act to push the food along. When the circular muscles contract and the longitudinal muscles relax, the gut is made narrower. When the opposite happens, i.e. the longitudinal muscles contract and the circular muscles relax, the gut becomes wider. Waves of muscle contraction like this pass along the gut, pushing the food along, rather like squeezing toothpaste from a tube. This is called peristalsis (Figure 4.13). It means that movement of food in the gut 
doesn’t depend on gravity – we can still eat standing on our heads!

A good definition of digestion is: 
‘Digestion is the chemical and mechanical breakdown of food. It converts large insoluble molecules into small soluble molecules, which can be absorbed into the blood.’

THE DIGESTIVE SYSTEM
Figure 4.14 shows a simplified diagram of the human digestive system. It is 
simplified so that you can see the order of the organs along the gut. The real gut is much longer than this, and coiled up so that it fills the whole space of the abdomen. Overall, its length in an adult is about 8
 m. This gives plenty of time
 
for the food to be broken down and absorbed as it passes through the gut.

▲ Figur e 4.14 The human digestive system
The mouth, stomach and the first part of the small intestine (called the 
duodenum) all break down the food using enzymes, either made in the gut wall itself, or by glands such as the pancreas. Digestion continues in the last part of the small intestine (the ileum) and it is here that the digested food is absorbed. The last part of the gut, the large intestine, is mainly concerned with absorbing water out of the remains, and storing the waste products (faeces) before they are removed from the body.

The three main classes of food are broken down by three classes of enzymes. 
Carbohydrates are digested by enzymes called carbohydrases. Proteins are acted upon by proteases, and enzymes called lipases break down lipids. Some of the places in the gut where these enzymes are made are shown in Table 4.5.
Digestion begins in the mouth. Saliva helps moisten the food and contains the 
enzyme amylase, which starts the breakdown of starch. The chewed lump of food, mixed with saliva, then passes along the oesophagus (gullet) to the stomach. 
Table 4.5 Some of the enzymes that digest food in the human gut. The substances shown in bold are the end products of digestion that can be absorbed 
from the gut into the blood.

1Maltose is a disaccharide made of two glucose molecules joined together.
2Peptides are short chains of amino acids.
The food is held in the stomach for several hours, while initial digestion of 
protein takes place. The stomach wall secretes hydrochloric acid, so the stomach contents are strongly acidic. This has a very important function. It kills bacteria that are taken into the gut along with the food, helping to protect us from food poisoning. The protease enzyme that is made in the stomach, called pepsin, has to be able to work in these acidic conditions, and has an optimum pH value of about 2. This is unusually low – most enzymes work best at near neutral conditions (see Chapter 1).
The semi-digested food is held back in the stomach by a ring of muscle at 
the outlet of the stomach, called a sphincter muscle. When this relaxes, it releases the food into the first part of the small intestine, called the duodenum (Figure 4.15).

Several digestive enzymes are added to the food in the duodenum. These 
are made by the pancreas, and digest starch, proteins and lipids (Table 4.5). As well as this, the liver makes a digestive juice called bile. Bile is a green liquid that is stored in the gall bladder and passes down the bile duct on to the food. Bile does not contain enzymes, but has another important function. It turns any large lipid globules in the food into an emulsion of tiny droplets (Figure 4.16). This increases the surface area of the lipid, so that lipase enzymes can break it down more easily.
Bile and pancreatic juice have another function. They are both alkaline. The 
mixture of semi-digested food and enzymes coming from the stomach is acidic, and needs to be neutralised by the addition of alkali before it continues on its way through the gut.
As the food continues along the intestine, more enzymes are added, until 
the parts of the food that can be digested have been fully broken down into soluble end products, which can be absorbed. This is the role of the last part of the small intestine, the ileum.
ABSORPTION IN THE ILEUM
The ileum is highly adapted to absorb the digested food. The lining of the ileum has a very large surface area, which means that it can quickly and efficiently absorb the soluble products of digestion into the blood. The length of the intestine helps to provide a large surface area, and this is aided by folds in its lining, but the greatest increase in area is due to tiny projections from the lining, called villi (Figure 4.17). 
(a) (b)
longitudinal and
circular muscle layers lining covered with villi
▲ Figur e 4.17 (a) The inside lining of the ileum is adapted to absorb digested food by the presence of 
millions of tiny villi. (b) Photo of the inside a patient’s ileum, taken using a camera attached to an 
endoscope. You can see thousands of tiny villi covering the lining.
The singular of villi is ‘villus’. Each villus is only about 1–2  mm long, but ther e 
are millions of them, so that the total area of the lining is thought to be about 
300
 
m2. This provides a massive area in contact with the digested food. As 
well as this, high-powered microscopy has revealed that the surface cells of each villus themselves have hundreds of minute projections, called microvilli, which increase the surface area for absorption even more (Figure 4.18).
Each villus contains a network of blood capillaries. Most of the digested food 
enters these blood vessels, but the products of fat digestion, as well as tiny fat droplets, enter a tube in the middle of the villus, called a lacteal. The lacteals form part of the body’s lymphatic system, which transports a liquid called lymph. This lymph eventually drains into the blood system too. ▲ Figur e 4.16 Bile turns fats into an emulsion

▲ Figur e 4.18 Each villus contains blood vessels and a lacteal, which absorb the products of 
digestion. The surface cells of the villus are covered with microvilli, which further increase the 
surface area for absorption.
The surface of a villus is made of a single layer of cells called an epithelium. 
This means that there is only a short distance between the digested food in the ileum and the blood capillaries making it easier for the products of digestion to diffuse through and enter the blood. The epithelium cells contain many mitochondria, which supply the energy needed for active transport of some substances.
In addition each villus contains muscle fibres which contract to move the villus. 
The villi are in constant motion, keeping them in contact with the contents of the ileum and maintaining a steep concentration gradient for diffusion of the products of digestion.
The blood vessels from the ileum join up to form a large blood vessel called 
the hepatic portal vein, which leads to the liver (see Chapter 5). The liver acts rather like a food processing factory, breaking some molecules down, and building up and storing others. For example, glucose from carbohydrate digestion is converted into glycogen and stored in the liver. Later, the glycogen can be converted back into glucose when the body needs it (see Chapter 7).
The digested food molecules are distributed around the body by the blood 
system (see Chapter 5). The soluble food molecules are absorbed from the blood into cells of tissues, and are used to build new parts of cells. This is called assimilation.
THE LARGE INTESTINE – ELIMINATION OF WASTE
By the time that the contents of the gut have reached the end of the small intestine, most of the digested food, as well as most of the water, has been absorbed. The waste material consists mainly of cellulose (fibre) and other indigestible remains, water, dead and living bacteria and cells lost from the lining of the gut. The function of the first part of the large intestine, called the colon, is to absorb most of the remaining water from the contents, leaving a semi-solid waste material called faeces. This is stored in the rectum, until expelled out of the body through the anus.KEY POINT
Removal of faeces by the body is 
sometimes incorrectly called excretion. Excretion is a word that only applies to materials that are the waste products of cells of the body, such as carbon dioxide. Faeces are not products of cell metabolism – they consist of waste that has passed through the gut and left the body via the anus, without entering the cells. The correct name for this process is egestion.

5 BLOOD AND CIRCULATION
Large, multicellular animals need a circulatory system to transport substances to and from the cells of the body. This

THE NEED FOR CIRCULATORY SYSTEMS
Figure 5.1 shows the circulatory system of a mammal.
Blood is pumped around a closed circuit made up of the heart and blood 
vessels. As it travels around the body, it collects materials from some places and unloads them in others. In mammals, blood transports:
 ◾o
xygen from the lungs to all other parts of the body
 ◾carbon dio
xide from all parts of the body to the lungs
 ◾nutrients fr
om the gut to all parts of the body
 ◾ur
ea from the liver to the kidneys.
Hormones, antibodies and many other substances are also transported by the blood. It also distributes heat around the body.
Single-celled organisms, like the ones shown in Figure 5.2, do not have 
circulatory systems.

▲ Figure 5.2 Unicellular organisms do not have circulatory systems.
There is no circulatory system to carry materials around the very small ‘bodies’ 
of these single-celled organisms. Materials can easily move around the cell without a special system. There is no need for lungs or gills to obtain oxygen from the environment either. Single-celled organisms obtain oxygen by diffusion through the surface membrane of the cell. The rest of the cell then uses the oxygen. The area of the cell’s surface determines how much oxygen the organism can get (the supply rate), and the volume of the cell determines how much oxygen the organism uses (the demand rate).
The ratio of supply to demand can be written as:  
   sur
face area   ____________  volume   
This is called the ‘sur
face area to volume ratio’ and it is affected by the size of 
an organism (see Chapter 1, Activity 4). Single-celled organisms have a high surface area to volume ratio. Their cell surface membrane has a large enough area to supply all the oxygen that their volume demands. In larger animals, the surface area to volume ratio is lower.
Large animals cannot get all the oxygen they need through their surface (even 
if the body surface would allow it to pass through) – there just isn’t enough surface to supply all that volume. To overcome this problem, large organisms have evolved special gas exchange organs and circulatory systems. The gills of fish and the lungs of mammals are linked to a circulatory system that carries oxygen to all parts of the body. The same idea applies to obtaining nutrients – the gut obtains nutrients from food and the circulatory system distributes the nutrients around the body.
THE CIRCULATORY SYSTEMS OF DIFFERENT ANIMALS
One of the main functions of a circulatory system in animals is to transport oxygen. Blood is pumped to a gas exchange organ to load oxygen. It is then pumped to other parts of the body where it unloads the oxygen. There are two main types of circulatory systems in animals.
 ◾In a
 single circulatory system the blood is pumped from the heart to the 
gas exchange organ and then directly to the rest of the body.
 ◾In a
 double circulatory system the blood is pumped from the heart to the 
gas exchange organ, back to the heart and then to the rest of the body.
Figure 5.3 shows the difference between these systems.pulmonary

▲ Figure 5.3 (a) The single circulatory system of a fish. The blood passes through the heart only 
once in a complete circuit of the body. (b) The double circulatory system of a human (and other mammals). The blood passes through the heart twice in one complete circuit of the body.
There are two parts to a double circulatory system:
 ◾The 
pulmonary circulation. Deoxygenated blood leaves the heart 
through the pulmonary arteries, and is circulated through the lungs, where 
it becomes oxygenated. The oxygenated blood returns to the heart through the pulmonary veins.
 ◾The 
systemic circulation. Oxygenated blood leaves the heart through the 
aorta and is circulated through all other parts of the body, where it unloads its oxygen. Deoxygenated blood returns to the heart through the vena cava.
A double circulatory system is more efficient than a single circulatory system. The heart pumps the blood twice, so higher pressures can be maintained. The blood travels more quickly to organs. In the single circulatory system of a fish, blood loses pressure as it passes through the gills. It then travels more slowly to the other organs.
The human circulatory system comprises:
 ◾the hear
t – this is a pump
 ◾blood vessels – these carr
y the blood around the body; arteries carry 
blood away from the heart and towards other organs, veins carry blood 
towards the heart and away from other organs and capillaries carry blood through organs, linking the arteries and veins
 ◾blood – the tr
ansport medium.
Figure 5.4 shows the main blood vessels in the human circulatory system.KEY POINT
‘Pulmonary’ means ‘relating to the 
lungs’.
DID YOU KNOW?
There are actually two vena 
cavae (the plural of vena cava). One brings blood back from the head and arms and the other returns blood from the rest of the body (see Figure 5.4).

THE STRUCTURE AND FUNCTION OF THE HUMAN HEART
The human heart is a pump (Figure 5.5). It pumps blood around the body at 
different speeds and at different pressures according to the body’s needs.

The bicuspid (mitral) and tricuspid valves are both sometimes called atrioventricular valves, as each controls the passage of blood from an atrium to a ventricle.

Blood is moved through the heart by a series of contractions and relaxations of 
the muscle in the walls of the four chambers. These events form the cardiac cycle. The main stages are illustrated in Figure 5.6.

45Blood ent ers the atria. 
It cannot yet pass
into the ventricles 
because the bicuspid
(mitral) and tricuspid 
valves ar e closed.The walls of the 
atria contract. 
This raises thepressure of blood in the atria which forces openthe bicuspid and tricuspid valves. Blood passesthrough these valves into the ventricles.
Key When the ventricles are full, they contract. This increases the pressure of blood in theventricles which closes the 
bicuspid and tricuspid valves 
again. Blood cannot return tothe atria. 
As the ventricles empty, higher pressure in the aorta and pulmonary ar tery 
closes the valves inthese blood vessels. The cycle then begins again as the atria start to ﬁll with blood.The ventricles continue to  
contract and the pressure continues to  increase. This 
forces open the semi-lunar valves at the base of the aorta and the pulmonary artery. Blood is ejected into 
these two arteries. The pulmonary ar tery 
carries blood to  the lungs. 
The aorta has branches that carry blood to all 
other parts of the body.oxygenated blood
deoxygenated blood
▲ Figure 5.6 The cardiac cycle.
The structure of the heart is adapted to its function in several ways:
 ◾It is divided int
o a left side and a right side by a wall of muscle called the 
septum. The right ventricle pumps blood only to the lungs while the left 
ventricle pumps blood to all other parts of the body. This requires much more pressure, which is why the wall of the left ventricle is much thicker than that of the right ventricle.
 ◾V
alves ensure that blood can flow only in one direction through the heart.
 ◾The walls of the 
atria are thin. They can be stretched to receive blood as 
it returns to the heart but can contract with enough force to push blood through the bicuspid and tricuspid valves into the ventricles.
 ◾The walls of the hear
t are made of cardiac muscle, which can contract 
and then relax continuously without becoming fatigued.
 ◾The car
diac muscle has its own blood supply – the coronary circulation. 
Blood reaches the muscle via coronary arteries. These carry blood to capillaries that supply the heart muscle with oxygen and nutrients. Blood is returned to the right atrium via coronary veins.HINT
Atria is the plural of atrium.
KEY POINTCardiac muscle is unlike any other 
muscle in our bodies. It never gets fatigued (‘tired’) like skeletal muscle. On average, cardiac muscle fibres contract and then relax again about 70 times a minute. In a lifetime of 70 years, this special muscle will contract over two billion times – without taking a rest!HINT
Note that during the cardiac cycle both 
atria contract at the same time (and then relax). After this both ventricles contract at the same time (and then relax). Students are sometimes confused about this, and think that one ventricle contracts, followed by the other.
